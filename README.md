Build a model to predict winning bid price for products post LOE

https://www.crowdanalytix.com/contests/predict-bidding-price-of-generic-drugs


## There are 2 main objectives to this contest:
1. Build a model to predict winning bid price for products after LOE (Loss of Exclusivity) for different geographies (identified by account, province, region)
  1. Predict Bid Price for products with Molecules 1 and 2 as active ingredients after LOE i.e. in 2016
2. Based on modeling, prepare a report to understand the dynamics of pricing strategies of vendors for different molecules in different markets. Some of the questions the report should be able to answer are as follows:
  1. Vendors with aggressive pricing strategies
  2. Geographies where pricing is aggressive or less aggressive 
  3. Segments where vendors tend to have more or less focus
  4. How presence of multiple vendors impact bidding prices
  5. Impact of volumes on winning bids
  6. Trends of bidding prices and its impact on new molecules.


## Q&A
1. What is the difference between pre LOE price data and post LOE data?
2. MAPE?
3. What is Price_per_standard_unit?
